Dear Visitor,<br />
Greetings. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, my Dad's health was adversely affected when he got COVID twice, amongst other reasons. <br />

Living in a different continent from my parents, there were alot of variable out of my control. So, in that moment, I did what I do best: find a solution throught software!

It has a Home page, using features like BootStrap and Typed.js by [@mattboldt](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js). In a Navber of the Home page, there are 4 options: Home![&#xF425;](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/assets/icons/house.svg), Today, Achievements and sort!
