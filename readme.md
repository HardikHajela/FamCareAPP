# Fam Care App.

Dear Visitor,<br />
Greetings. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, my Dad's health was adversely affected due to COVID, amongst other reasons that elevated. <br />

Living in a different continent from my parents, there were alot of variable out of my control. So, in that moment, I did what I do best: find a solution through software! I took all the software engineering in me and made this PWA in a span of 3 days. It has a couple of featues with which I can track my parent's heath.<br/>

It has a Home page, using features like BootStrap and Typed.js by [@mattboldt](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js). In a Navber of the Home page, there are 4 options:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<img src="https://github.com/HardikHajela/FamCareAPP/blob/main/readmeicons/home.png" alt="home" height = "60"/> 
<img src="https://github.com/HardikHajela/FamCareAPP/blob/main/readmeicons/today.png" alt="today" height="60"/> 
<img src="https://github.com/HardikHajela/FamCareAPP/blob/main/readmeicons/ach.png" alt="Achievements" height="60"/> 
<img src="https://github.com/HardikHajela/FamCareAPP/blob/main/readmeicons/sort.png" alt="sort" height="60"/> <br />

The "Today" page is a basic Webform in which, a couple questions are asked about the Day! <br />
It's based on 5 Parameters: Routine, Exercise, Diet, Medications and Stress. <br />

Once filled, it does checks for the required fields and once validated, sends all the information to a PHP file, which then saves the entered information in the MariaDB(MySQL) Database. <br />

Every entry from earlier is analyzed and after some calculations, is then assigned a "Score"!. In the Achievements section, all the entries are represented via color in a tabular form! Since the theme is Dark, the design is lighter the representation of score, the better! This display's motivation came from the way GitHub represent's commits on someone's profile! <br />

Lastly, in the Sort section, the achievements can be viewed and sorted as per the parameters entered for the day!

This application is a Prograssive Web App and was made solely by me in a Span of 3 days. If there's anything regarding to the App or the code you'd like to convey, I'm always open to Questions, Concerns and Comments. Any Input'll be appriciated! :D <br />

Thank you! Have a Good one! :)
